# Schork-Custom-Construction

As for my project I decided to do it on Schork Custom Construction.  This is a start up company and I wanted to showcase the before and after work
of the installation of double doors that was done on his clients home.  It shows the removal of a section of wall, the relocation of a vent pipe. 
The installation of the door and the Coustom Trim added.  I also have added two projects a hat rack and a flagbox that he has done at his home.
